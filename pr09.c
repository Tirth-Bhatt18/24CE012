/*
Determine the grade of a student based on their marks using the conditional
(ternary) operator. Take studentâ€™s marks as input and display the corresponding
grade as output according to the following criteria:
Marks >= 90: Grade A
Marks >= 80 and < 90: Grade B
Marks >= 70 and < 80: Grade C
Marks >= 60 and < 70: Grade D
Marks < 60: Grade F
Validate the input by ensuring user is entering marks between 0-100, else declare
that the entered input is invalid.
